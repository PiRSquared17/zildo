#summary What about Dialogs ?

= Introduction =

Before talking about dialogs in Zildo, we'll start by a brief topo on UI texts. Then, we'll approach the ways dialogs are stored, displayed and articulated inside the game.

= UI Text =

Dialog are a subset of all User Interface text existing in the project. Let's present all the UI text in Zildo.

They are divided into 3 sections : menu, game, and credits. Their meaning is pretty clear, but in details :
 * [http://code.google.com/p/zildo/source/browse/trunk/zildo/src/zildo/resource/bundle/menu.properties menu] : all text labels found on the menu side : main menu, in-game menu, all messages about internet connection or whatever
 * [http://code.google.com/p/zildo/source/browse/trunk/zildo/src/zildo/resource/bundle/game.properties game] : all messages displayed inside the game, including dialogs, multiplayer messages, items name and automatic text for the first time Zildo picks an item
 * [http://code.google.com/p/zildo/source/browse/trunk/zildo/src/zildo/resource/bundle/credits.properties credits] : text displayed in the credits. There's only one multi-line value

All UI texts are internationalized with keys. For now (09/2012), we have 2 languages : french and english (default one).
