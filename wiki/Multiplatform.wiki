*Multiplatform limitations*

The technologies choice (Java, LWJGL) has been made in order to adress every platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS) but there still exists some limitations.

Everything's fine on following configs:
 * Windows XP with any graphic card
 * Windows Vista/7 with NVIDIA card

Not working on:
 * MacOS X (dependancy problem with DevIL, should be replaced by another library, to be continued...)
 * Windows Vista/7 with some ATI cards (ATI drivers are not right for all ATI cards, Radeon 9600 for example)

Never tested on:
 * Linux
