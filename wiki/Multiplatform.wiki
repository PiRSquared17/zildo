*Multiplatform limitations*

The technologies choice (Java, LWJGL) has been made in order to adress every platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS) but there still exist some limitations.

Everything's fine on following configs:
-Windows XP with any graphic card
-Windows Vista/7 with NVIDIA card

Not working on:
-MacOS X (dependancy problem with DevIL, should be replaced by another library, to be continued...)

Never tested on:
-Linux
