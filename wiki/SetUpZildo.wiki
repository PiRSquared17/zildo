=How set up a Zildo workspace=

I assumed that you're using Eclipse for developing Zildo, and you're a little bit familiar with.

So this is the steps you should follow:

  # Install subclipse
   Find the right one on this page
   http://subclipse.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectProcess?pageID=p4wYuA
  # Check out zildo project with this URL :
   https://zildo.googlecode.com/svn
  # Create a run configuration on 'zildo.Zildo' class.
    Put these lines in the VM arguments (Arguments tab):<br/>
    `-Djava.library.path="c:\Code\Projets java\lwjgl-2.0.1\native\win32" -Xmx80M -Dsun.java2d.noddraw=false`<br/><br/>
    Where you should replace the path with yours, indeed. 
  # Edit the `Constantes.java` class at line 7 :<br/>
    `public static final String DATA_PATH = "C:\\Data\\";`<br/>
    And replace the path by the one where you store the Zildo's data folder.
    If you haven't any one, please download the latest Zildoxxx.jar and the downloads section.
  # F11 or CTRL+F11 to debug/run, and you're up to work on this amazing project !
