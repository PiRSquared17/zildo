*How set up a Zildo workspace*

I assumed that you're using Eclipse for developing Zildo, and you're a little bit familiar with.

So this is the steps you should follow:

#1) Install subclipse

#2) Check out zildo project with this URL :
   https://zildo.googlecode.com/svn

#3) Create a run configuration on 'zildo.Zildo' class.
   Put these lines in the VM arguments (Arguments tab):

-Djava.library.path="c:\Code\Projets java\lwjgl-2.0.1\native\win32" -Xmx80M -Dsun.java2d.noddraw=false

Where you replace the path with yours, indeed.

#4) F11 or CTRL+F11 to debug/run, and you're up to work on this amazing project !
